    There are two ways to solve this machine.
    <ol>
        <li>Intended Way</li>
        <li>Unintended Way</li>
    </ol>
</h4>
<h4>
    You can follow the steps below to solve it using the intended way or you can check out another writeup by
    <code>xyro</code> who found an unintended way to solve this machine which is something very few people would have
    found and his approach to solve this machine is also unique. Link to his write is here => <a
        href="http://xyro.codes/THM/eavesdropper/writeup.html">xyro's writeup</a>
</h4>

<p>
    <strong>Intended way :</strong>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Step 1 :</strong><br>
        LogIn to the machine using <code>idrsa.id-rsa</code> provided in task 1 with username <code>frank</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Step 2 :</strong><br>
        Transfer <code>pspy</code> onto the target machine and run it for a while. You will find an intresting
        command being executed. <code>sudo cat /etc/shadow</code>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Step 3 :</strong><br>
        Time for <a href="https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-hardening/privilege-escalation#sudo-hijacking">sudo
            hijacking</a>.
        While creating our sudo executable, we have to be a little bit creative. Trying to get a reverse shell won't
        be useful. If u hijack sudo so that it spawns a reverse shell instead, the reverse shell u get back would be of
        the frank user because the sudo elevation hasn't happened yet. Instead we can capture the password entered by
        frank using a little bit of shell scripting. (Thanks you xyro for these words üòÅ).
        <code>sudo cat /etc/shadow</code> command.<br>
        Follow these steps to capture the password.
        <ol>
            <li>
                <code>touch /tmp/sudo</code> creating our own sudo executable.
            </li>
            <li>content of sudo file <br>
                <code>#!/bin/bash</code> -- I don't think i need to explain this. <br>
                <code>read -s password</code> -- after executes the command, this will read the password and store it in
                the password variable. <code>-s</code> is used so that the input is not displayed. Something i'm used to
                do.<br>
                <code>echo $password > /home/frank/pass.txt</code> -- echoing the password from password variable to
                pass.txt so that we can read it once catured. <br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>chmod +x /tmp/sudo</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                Modify you <code>$PATH</code> variable using <code>.bashrc</code> <br>
                <img src="./img/bashrc.png" alt="bashrc"> <br>
                Save the changes and wait for a few seconds after which you will see a pass.txt which has the password
                that can be used to switch to root.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Step 4 :</strong><br>
        Copy the password from pass.txt and do <code>/usr/bin/sudo su</code> and get the root flag.
    </li>
</ul>
